# Python_Mini-Project

In this mini project, we successfully answered each case provided with the following results:

In the first case for surveying the socio-economic condition of the community, we used a pandas dataframe to store the input data from users. The status_economic() function was used to determine the economic status based on the entered income. Exception handling was implemented in case a user entered a negative income value. In the second case, we managed to save student grade data (assignment, midterm exam, final exam) into a DataFrame by generating the grade values randomly using NumPy. Then, a new column for the final grade was calculated based on the weight of each grade component. Finally, a predicate column was created to bin the final grades into categories like A, B, C, etc. using pandas cut().
